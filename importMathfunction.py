import math as d
# If we don't want to use math name here and want to take single char,In python we have alias
s= d.sqrt(25)
print(s)

# In python we have floor and ciel functions, if we want to get the round of number there we can use
# Floor will give the least value of number
# Ciel will give you highest value of number

print(d.floor(2.9))
print(d.ceil(2.9))
print(d.pow(2,5))

# if we want to use only specific function then we can use 'from math import sqrt,pow etc.
